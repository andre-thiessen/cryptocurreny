# Cryptocurrency (ERC20)

This tutorial is part of my studies about web3 and blockchain development

## How to run

## What was developed

In this simple tutorial, it was developed a smart contract in solidity to create a cryptocurrency.

It was based on ERC20 Token ("https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol")

### What is ERC20?
The ERC-20 introduces a standard for Fungible Tokens, in other words, they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) as another Token. For example, an ERC-20 Token acts just like the ETH, meaning that 1 Token is and will always be equal to all the other Tokens.
